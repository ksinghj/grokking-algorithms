With this knowledge of algorithms, it is useful to structure our data in a way that is 
best to work with algorithms, if we can. For example sorted arrays would allow us to perform
binary search operations and save lots of time with large data sets.

5.1) Consistent, but not useful!
5.2) Not consistent.
5.3) Not consistent.
5.4) Consistent.

5.5) C would actually be useful here, as would D of course (it's a proper hash function).
5.6) B would work here, because the only variation is the size of the string. D also.
5.7) D here would work well of course, but C as well?.. As the titles all start with different letters.
