✅❌ 10.1) Multiply Pinky's ratings by 1.5 or multiply Yogi's ratings by 0.5 -
    results in similar numbers.
✅ I guess I kind of got this one right, I just didn't call it `normalisation`.

✅ 10.2) Multiply Influencer's ratings by X, where X is the weight of their rating over normal users.

Classification - Categorisation into a group.
Regression - predicting a response.

✅ 10.3) Definitely too low! I imagine they would take advantage of such a large dataset and use 
    nearest 10,000 neighbours at least!
✅ Good rule of thumb is for N users, use sqrt(N) neighbours
